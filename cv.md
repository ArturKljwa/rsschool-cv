## **Summary:**

- Hello, I want to become a beginner front-end developer. I like programming. I strive to develop in this direction. At the moment I am not working in my specialty. But I did a few tutorial projects and I really liked it. In the future, I would like to learn JavaScript at a high level, as well as learn the React library. I would be glad to work with professionals in the same team.
